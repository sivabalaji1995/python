**`DefaultAzureCredential` from `azure.identity`:**

- It‚Äôs a **convenience authentication class** that tries multiple authentication methods in order, such as:  
  - Environment variables (client ID, secret, tenant ID)  
  - Managed Identity (if running in Azure)  
  - Azure CLI logged-in user  
  - Visual Studio Code credentials, etc.

- This means you don‚Äôt have to hardcode which credential to use ‚Äî it automatically picks the best available one for your environment.  
- Great for development and production since it adapts based on where your code runs.

---

**`ComputeManagementClient` from `azure.mgmt.compute`:**

- It‚Äôs a **client class in the Azure SDK for Python** used to manage Azure Virtual Machines (VMs) and related compute resources.  
- Provides methods to perform VM operations such as:  
  - Creating, starting, stopping, restarting, deleting VMs  
  - Managing VM sizes, extensions, and disks  
- You create this client by passing an authenticated credential object (like `DefaultAzureCredential`) and your Azure subscription ID.

---

### Example:

```python
from azure.identity import DefaultAzureCredential
from azure.mgmt.compute import ComputeManagementClient

credential = DefaultAzureCredential()
subscription_id = "your-subscription-id"

compute_client = ComputeManagementClient(credential, subscription_id)

# List all VMs in the subscription
for vm in compute_client.virtual_machines.list_all():
    print(vm.name)
```

---

**Summary:**  
- `DefaultAzureCredential`: Automatically handles Azure authentication.  
- `ComputeManagementClient`: Manages Azure VMs using the authenticated credentials.


====================================================================================================

```python
credential = DefaultAzureCredential()
```

**What it does:**

- This line creates an instance of `DefaultAzureCredential` from the `azure.identity` library.  
- `DefaultAzureCredential` attempts to authenticate your Python application to Azure by trying multiple authentication methods **in a specific order**, including:  
  - Environment variables (if set)  
  - Managed Identity (if running inside an Azure service with managed identity)  
  - Azure CLI credentials (if you‚Äôre logged in via Azure CLI)  
  - Visual Studio Code credentials  
  - And others

- It **automatically picks the first available and valid credential** it finds.  

- This means your app can seamlessly authenticate whether it's running locally (using Azure CLI login or environment variables) or running in Azure (using managed identity), without changing your code.

**In short:**  
`credential = DefaultAzureCredential()` sets up a flexible, environment-aware authentication object to get Azure access tokens for your Python application.

# üîç **Explanation of the Code Snippet**

The given Python snippet iterates over all Virtual Machines (VMs) in a specific Azure Resource Group (`rgname`),  
checks for a specific tag (`env=dev`), stops those VMs, and prints their power status.

---

### **Step-by-step breakdown**

1. **List all VMs in a resource group**
   ```python
   for vm in compute.virtual_machines.list(rgname):
   ```
   - Calls Azure SDK‚Äôs `list()` method to retrieve all VM objects in the resource group `rgname`.
   - Each `vm` here is an object containing VM properties like `name`, `tags`, `location`, etc.

2. **Safely handle missing tags**
   ```python
   tags = vm.tags or {}
   ```
   - If `vm.tags` is `None` (VM has no tags), `tags` is set to an empty dictionary `{}` to avoid errors.
   - Prevents `AttributeError` when calling `.get()` later.

3. **Check for a specific tag value**
   ```python
   if vm.tags.get('env') == 'dev':
   ```
   - Uses `.get()` to retrieve the value for the `'env'` tag.
   - If the value is `"dev"`, it means this VM belongs to the development environment and should be stopped.
   - `.get()` is safer than `['env']` because it avoids `KeyError` if the tag is missing.

4. **Print stopping message**
   ```python
   print(f"stopping the {vm.name} having tag value dev")
   ```
   - Displays which VM is being stopped.

5. **Deallocate (stop) the VM**
   ```python
   compute.virtual_machines.begin_deallocate(rgname, vm.name)
   ```
   - Calls Azure‚Äôs asynchronous deallocation operation.
   - Frees compute resources but keeps the OS disk and data disks intact.
   - VM status will transition from `"PowerState/running"` ‚Üí `"PowerState/deallocated"`.

6. **Get VM instance view**
   ```python
   vmdetail = compute.virtual_machines.get(rgname, vm.name, expand="instanceView")
   ```
   - Fetches detailed runtime info about the VM, including power state.
   - The `expand="instanceView"` parameter ensures the API returns the current VM status.

7. **Retrieve status list**
   ```python
   status_object = vmdetail.instance_view.statuses
   ```
   - `statuses` is a list of `InstanceViewStatus` objects.
   - Each status has attributes like `.code`, `.display_status`, `.level`, `.message`.

8. **Filter power state**
   ```python
   for status in status_object:
       if status.code.startswith("PowerState/"):
           print(f"{vm.name} is in {status.display_status} state")
   ```
   - Loops through each status.
   - `.code` values might look like `"PowerState/running"`, `"PowerState/deallocated"`, etc.
   - When a matching code is found, prints a human-readable display status like `"VM running"` or `"VM deallocated"`.

---

### **Key Points**
- `vm.tags or {}` ensures no crash if a VM has no tags.
- `.get()` avoids `KeyError` for missing tag keys.
- `begin_deallocate()` is asynchronous ‚Äî without `.wait()`, the state check might still show "running".
- `instance_view.statuses` contains multiple status objects; we filter only `PowerState/*` entries.

### **Example Output**
```yaml
stopping the dev-vm01 having tag value dev
dev-vm01 is in VM deallocated state

stopping the dev-vm02 having tag value dev
dev-vm02 is in VM deallocated state
```
